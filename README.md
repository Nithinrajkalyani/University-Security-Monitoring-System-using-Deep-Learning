# University-Security-Monitoring-System-using-Deep-Learning

We have proposed a framework to provide a security solution to University, to keep track the students who does not belongs to University. Generally, some unknown person wears the id cards of his friend or a fake id of a person to get enter into the campus. 

So, we have a identified this problem, thus we have proposed a framework to provide a solution using deep learning to keep an eye on the students as well as unknown person. 

Hence, the proposed solution is to develop a working prototype of a system that can assist University in maintaining the list of unknown persons who come from entrance gate control by detecting the frontal faces of students from a picture taken in a classroom. Additionally, the system will perform facial recognition against a small database. The system is improve the security system of our University efficiently.
